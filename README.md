# Weather app UI
All attempts have been made to build the weather app UI according to the expectations of the 
technical requirements with the following exceptions;

***redux-thunk has been used instead of the required middleware redux-saga specified in the document.
The reason for this is that I have never used redux-saga and was not confident I would be able to efficiently
utilise it to produce the required results.


## Running the app.
 * First install node modules by running the following command;
```shell
npm i
```

 * Once node modules are installed, run the command below to run the app;
 ```shell
npm run start
```

 * To run tests, use the following command;
 ```shell
npm run test
```

There is much I am still learning with regards to using Typescript in general and using Typescript in a
react/redux project in particular. Any feedback that can help me improve and and correct any errorneous
 understandings would be most appreciated.
